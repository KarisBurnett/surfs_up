## Overview
Mr. Avy wants more information about the temperature trends before opening his surf shop. He specifically would like temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results
Three Key Differences: 
1. There is very little fluctuation in the average temperature from June to December. 
2. There is also very little fluctuation in the max temperatures from June to December.
3. The min temperature fluctuation is about 10 degree difference which shows the most variance. 

## Summary

Overall, with the little variation on both max and average I would say that it is safe to open the shop. 

An additional query to run would be precipitation to figure out the statistics of rain in the area. Rain may have an influence on traffic coming through the shop. I would also be interested in the exact location of the shop. Hawaii is pretty big and may have different weather happening in different parts of the islands. The exact location would help determine the weather patterns.
